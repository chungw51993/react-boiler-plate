# React Express Boilerplate
This is my personal boiler plate for React and Node

- You will need to create a .env file on the root directory
  - Need NODE_ENV and PORT variables for now
- Webpack is configured for Sass

## Getting Started
```
npm install
npm start
```

THIS BOILERPLATE IS NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION
